# Predicting-Cardio-Vascular-disease

**Cardiovascular disease prediction**
**Problem Description :**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 31% of all deaths globally. Early diagnosis and prevention of CVDs are crucial in reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with these diseases. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of CVDs in individuals based on their health data.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for this project is the “Cardiovascular Disease dataset” from Kaggle. The dataset contains 70,000 records of patients aged 30-70 years, and it includes 11 features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and more. The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether the patient has CVD or not.

**Objectives:**

The objectives of this project are:
1. To explore and visualize the dataset.
2. To preprocess and clean the dataset.
3. To build a machine learning model to predict the risk of CVDs.
4. To evaluate the performance of the model.
5. To fine-tune the model to improve its performance.
6. To deploy the model and make predictions on new data.

**General Framework and Steps:**

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Data visualization
4. Feature selection and engineering
5. Model selection and training
6. Model evaluation
7. Model fine-tuning
8. Model deployment and prediction

In the first step, we load the dataset and explore its features and target variable.

In the second step, we preprocess the data by handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

In the third step, we visualize the data to gain insights and identify patterns.

In the fourth step, we perform feature selection and engineering to select the most relevant features and create new features if necessary.

In the fifth step, we select a machine learning model and train it on the preprocessed data.

In the sixth step, we evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

In the seventh step, we fine-tune the model by adjusting its hyperparameters and repeating the training and evaluation process.

In the final step, we deploy the model and make predictions on new data.

By following this framework and steps, we can develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the risk of CVDs in individuals based on their health data.

**Code Explanation :**

Here is the simple explanation for the code which is provided in the code file.

The code provided above is written in Python and is aimed at predicting the presence of cardiovascular disease in an individual based on various attributes such as age, gender, height, weight, cholesterol levels, etc. The code follows a general framework for machine learning projects which includes data preprocessing, model selection, and model evaluation.

Section 1: Data Preprocessing In the first section of the code, we read the data from the CSV file and perform some preprocessing steps such as removing duplicates and null values. We also transform some of the attributes to make them more useful for the model.

Section 2: Model Selection In the second section, we split the data into training and testing sets and select a suitable model for the prediction task. In this code, we have used a Random Forest Classifier for the prediction task.

Section 3: Model Evaluation In the final section, we train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also plot the confusion matrix to visualize the model’s performance.

**Running the Code:**

To run the code, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system along with some libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

1. First, install the required libraries using the following command:
      Pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

2. Next, save the code provided above in a Python file with the extension .py.

3. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.

4. Finally, run the code using the following command:
Python filename.py

Make sure to replace “filename.py” with the actual name of your Python file.

Upon running the code, you should see the output of the evaluation metrics along with the confusion matrix plot.
Future Work :

1. Feature Engineering: In the current project, we have used only a limited number of features for our model. In the future, we can explore more features that could have an impact on cardiovascular disease and use them to improve our model’s performance.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: We can try different hyperparameters of our models to find the best set of hyperparameters for better performance.

3. Model Ensemble: We can use the ensemble of different models to improve the overall performance of the model.

4. Using Different Models: We have used Random Forest and XGBoost for our project. In the future, we can try using other models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and other models to see which model works best for our dataset.

5. Using Advanced Techniques: We can use advanced techniques such as Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, and other techniques to improve the performance of our model.
Step-by-Step Guide on How to Implement Future Work

1. Feature Engineering: To explore more features for our model, we can start by analyzing the data and finding any other features that could have an impact on cardiovascular disease. We can then add these features to our dataset and retrain our model.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning: To tune the hyperparameters of our model, we can use a grid search or a randomized search technique to find the best set of hyperparameters for our model. We can then retrain our model with these hyperparameters.

3. Model Ensemble: To use the ensemble of different models, we can train multiple models and combine their predictions using techniques such as voting, averaging, or stacking.

4. Using Different Models: To use different models, we can start by selecting a few models that are known to perform well on similar datasets. We can then train these models and compare their performance to select the best model for our dataset.

5. Using Advanced Techniques: To use advanced techniques such as Deep Learning, we can start by converting our dataset into a format suitable for Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We can then train these models and compare their performance with our current model. We can also explore Transfer Learning techniques by using pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG, or Inception for our task.
